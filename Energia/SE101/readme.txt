Simple first project in Energia with Texas Instruments Civa Board and Orbit Booster Pack (LED Display).

Long story short, we made singleplayer pong. It's the user vs the wall on the otherside.

There is a points and life system, as well as hitting it at different points on the paddle will bounce it to different angles.
